MysticBBS Server Edition

This project is about making a MysticBBS server which will take minimum disk space and used to launch scripts/doors individually. Install this in a VPS and create something like an ANSI/WWW thing... and build your own ANSI/ASCII pages/scripts/mods/demos!!!!


To configure, edit the startup.mps file. Don't forget to compile it with MPLC, after making changes.
